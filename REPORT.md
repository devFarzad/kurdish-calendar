# Kurdish Calendar Package - Project Report

## Project Structure Analysis

The original Kurdish Calendar project was a Next.js application that included both UI components and core calendar functionality. The core functionality was mixed with UI-specific code, making it difficult to reuse in other projects.

### Original Structure

- **lib/** - Core functionality but mixed with UI-specific code
  - **getKurdishDate.ts** - Kurdish date conversion logic
  - **jalaali.ts** - Jalaali (Persian) calendar utilities
  - **date-utils.ts** - Date formatting and manipulation utilities
  - **utils.ts** - UI-specific utilities

- **types/** - Type definitions
  - **holidays.ts** - Holiday data types

- **public/data/** - Data files
  - **holidays.json** - Holiday and event data

### Issues Identified

1. **Tight Coupling**: Core calendar functionality was tightly coupled with UI components
2. **Mixed Concerns**: Utility functions mixed UI and core calendar logic
3. **Lack of Modularity**: No clear separation between core functionality and application-specific code
4. **Limited Reusability**: Difficult to reuse the calendar functionality in other projects
5. **No Package Structure**: Missing proper package configuration for distribution

## Improvements Made

### 1. Clean Code and Modularity

- **Separated Core Functionality**: Extracted pure calendar logic from UI components
- **Clear Module Boundaries**: Each module has a single responsibility
- **Improved Type Definitions**: Enhanced TypeScript types with comprehensive documentation
- **Consistent Naming**: Applied consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase

### 2. Package Structure

Created a proper npm package structure:

```

│   │   ├── kurdish-calendar.ts # Kurdish calendar logic
│   │   ├── date-utils.ts # Date utilities
│   │   └── holidays.ts   # Holiday management
│   ├── data/             # Data files
│   │   └── holidays.json # Holiday data
│   ├── types/            # Type definitions

├── LICENSE               # MIT license
└── README.md             # Documentation
```

### 3. Documentation

- **Comprehensive README**: Created a detailed README with installation, usage examples, and API documentation
- **JSDoc Comments**: Added thorough JSDoc comments to all functions and types
- **Type Definitions**: Enhanced type definitions with descriptive comments

### 4. Build and Test Configuration

- **Rollup Configuration**: Set up Rollup for bundling with proper output formats (CommonJS, ESM)
- **TypeScript Configuration**: Configured TypeScript for type checking and declaration generation
- **Jest Configuration**: Set up Jest for testing with TypeScript support
- **NPM Scripts**: Added scripts for building, testing, linting, and publishing

### 5. API Design

- **Clean API**: Designed a clean, intuitive API for calendar functionality
- **Convenience Methods**: Added convenience methods for common use cases
- **Flexible Options**: Provided options for customization and localization
- **Default Export**: Created a default export with commonly used functions

## Publishing Instructions

To publish the Kurdish Calendar package to npm, follow these steps:

### 1. Prepare for Publishing

1. Update package.json with your information:
   - Update the `name` field if needed
   - Set the appropriate `version` (follow semantic versioning)
   - Update `author`, `repository`, `homepage`, and `bugs` fields

2. Build the package:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Test the package:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

4. Lint the code:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

### 2. Publishing to npm

1. Login to npm:
   ```bash
   npm login
   ```

2. Publish the package:
   ```bash
   npm publish
   ```

### 3. Version Management

For future updates, use npm's version commands:

1. For patch updates (bug fixes):
   ```bash
   npm version patch
   ```

2. For minor updates (new features, backward compatible):
   ```bash
   npm version minor
   ```

3. For major updates (breaking changes):
   ```bash
   npm version major
   ```

These commands will:
- Update the version in package.json
- Create a git tag
- Run the version script (which formats the code and adds changes to git)

After versioning, publish the new version:
```bash
npm publish
```

## Conclusion

The Kurdish Calendar package has been transformed from a tightly coupled application-specific code into a clean, modular, and reusable npm package. The package now follows best practices for code organization, documentation, and distribution.

Key improvements include:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive documentation
- Proper package configuration
- Test coverage
- Type safety

The package is now ready for distribution and can be easily integrated into any JavaScript or TypeScript project.
