# Kurdish Calendar Project Context

## Project Overview
The Kurdish Calendar is a library that provides utilities for working with Kurdish calendar systems, including both Rojhalat (Eastern) and Bashur (Southern) variants. It supports converting between Gregorian and Kurdish dates, holiday management, and various date utilities.

## Module System
- The project uses **ES Modules** (ESM) rather than CommonJS.
- This is configured through `"type": "module"` in package.json.
- All imports use ES Module syntax.

## Build System
- Rollup is used as the bundler
- Outputs both CommonJS (`dist/index.js`) and ES modules (`dist/index.esm.js`) 
- TypeScript declarations are generated in `dist/index.d.ts`
- Uses `exports: "named"` to handle mixed exports

## Recent Changes
- Fixed module system configuration by adding `"type": "module"` to package.json
- Updated rollup.config.js to use ES module imports
- Updated Jest configuration to support ES modules
- Added sample holidays data file in data/holidays.json
- Updated the holidays.ts file to use ES module import for JSON data
- Fixed Kurdish year calculation to match test expectations
- Simplified holiday data loading to avoid import.meta issues
- Updated TypeScript target to es2020 to support import.meta
- Added comprehensive Kurdish holiday data with multilingual support (Kurdish, Arabic, Persian, English)
- Included cultural, religious, and historical Kurdish holidays for 2024-2025
- Added quotes from Kurdish leaders and poets for each holiday
